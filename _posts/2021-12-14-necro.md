I've recently learned English word "pernicious", which means "extremely severe or life-threatening" or "having a very harmful effect".
This word contains the Latin intensifying prefix "per-" and "necō" that means "I kill".

Latin "necō" leads us to a common English prefix "necro-", which forms words relating to "death", "dead bodies", or "dead tissue".
Let's take a quick look at a couple of words with "necro-".

## necrosis
"Necrosis" is the combination of "necro-" and "-sis", suffix that forms nouns of condition in medicine.
It means "death of tissue or cells" (which corresponds to Japanese 壊死).

## necrophilia
This word can be splitted into "necro-" and the suffix "-philia" meaning "love of or liking for"[^post-philo].
Therefore, necrophilia means "fascination with death", especially "sexual attraction to, or intercourse with, dead bodies" (cf. pedophilia).

[^post-philo]: I wrote about the prefix "philo-" in [this post](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/10/26/philo.html).
