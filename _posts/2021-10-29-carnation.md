The Latin word "carō" means "flesh".
When I saw this, the first thing that came to my mind was the word *carnival*.
This word seems to come from the Latin expression *carne levare* meaning "remove flesh"[^wiki-carnival].
It is a festival that takes place before Lent, where some people practice fasting, especially from meat and alcohol.

*Carrion*, *carnage*, *carnivore*, and *carnal* are English words directly related to animal flesh.
*Carrion* means "dead or decaying flesh", while *carnage* means "a heap of dead bodies" (hence "the slaughter of a great number, esp. of men").
*Carnivore* is a combination of *carō* and *devour*, and the latter is a common English word meaning "to eat voraciously", which makes perfect sense.
*Carnal* means "characterized by the flesh or the body".

Other words figuratively related to flesh include *incarnate* and *carnation*.
*Incarnate* means "to embody (in flesh)" as a verb and "embodied in flesh" as an adjective.
It is interesting that the name of the flower, *carnation*, also derives from this origin in terms of its color.
The next time you see a carnation, you may notice that its color somehow resembles the color of animal flesh....
