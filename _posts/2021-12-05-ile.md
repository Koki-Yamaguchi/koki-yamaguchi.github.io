The other day, I wrote about the Latin word "facilis" that means "easy" in [this post](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/12/02/facilis.html).
In Latin, facilis is the combination of "faciō" (I do or I make) and the suffix "-ilis" (or "-īlis").
This suffix often forms adjectives that mean "able to be done" or "that may be done".
In other words, suffix "-ilis" works in the similar way as "-bilis", which is the origin of "-(a)ble" in English.

Therefore, the meaning of facilis can be understood as "able to be done or made".
In English, this suffix can be seen in the form "-ile" or "-il".
Applying the same logic, we can understand some more words such as "fossile", "agile", "fragile", and "docile".

## fossil
The "foss" part comes from the stem of the Latin word "fodiō", meaning "I dig".
Thus, fossil can be interpreted as "that may be dug", although today it usually means "something preserved in the ground, especially in petrified form in rock".

## agile
The Latin verb "agō" basically means "I act" and has so many descendants in English, one of which is "agile".
The meaning of agile can be considered as "able to be acted or moved (easily)", which results in today's meaning "able to move quickly".

## fragile
"That may be broken", with the Latin "frangō", meaning "I break" (seen in "fracture").

## docile
"Able to be taught", with "doceō" meaning "I teach" (seen in "doctor").
Docile today can simply mean "easy to control" (not really about teaching).
