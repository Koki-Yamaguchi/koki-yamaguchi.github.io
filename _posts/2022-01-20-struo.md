English word *strew* means "to spread loosely" (past participle *strewn*).
It is easy to associate this word with the PIE *\*strew-* meaning "to spread", which is indeed the origin of *strew*.

The sound of *strew* /struː/ made me think of another English word *construe* (*con-* + *strue*), which originally meant "to form by putting together materials" and today means "interpret in a specified way".
This is not a coincidence, because *construe* comes from the Latin *struō* (meaning "I construct", "I arrange"), which ultimately comes from the PIE *\*strew-*.

As you probably notice, there are many words derived from *struō*: *structure*, *construct*, *destruct*, *destroy*, *obstruct*, *instruct*, *instrument*.
*Instruct* has the prefix *in-* meaning "inside", which makes the sense "build into" or "teach".
The suffix *-ment* in *instrument*, in this case, comes from the Latin suffix *-mentum*, which indicates the sense "medium" (cf. English *ornament* from *ōrnō* (I equip)).
