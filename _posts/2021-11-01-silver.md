Today we will look at two English idioms that contain the word "silver".

## Silver Tongue
"Silver tongue" means "the trait of being articulate, charming, or eloquent". We can easily understand this expression by interpreting the adjective silver in a broader sense. Silver can mean "having a clear gentle resonance like that of silver" (although in this sense, "silvery" is more commonly used than "silver", e.g., a silvery voice). As a derivative of this, "silver-tongued" is also often used as an adjective.

## Silver Lining
"Silver lining" is a metaphor for hope or a sign of a positive aspect in a negative situation. The expression was coined by the English poet John Milton in 1637.

> Was I deceiv'd, or did a sable cloud Turne forth her silver lining on the night?[^oed-lining]

"Every cloud has a silver lining" is a fairly common proverb. Needless to say, it is easy to imagine a scene where a shaft of sunlight shines through the black clouds.
