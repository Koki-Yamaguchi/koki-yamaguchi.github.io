When I learned the English word "fetus", I immediately wondered what its plural form is.
Looking at the [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fetus#English), I understood that its plural form is "fetuses".
And at the same time, I noticed that it also read "(hypercorrect) feti", which I had considered as a possible answer.

"Hypercorrection" generally refers to the non-standard use of language based on a false analogy with a correct form (which is called 過剰修正 in Japanese).
One typical example is the usage of "between you and I".
This is totally understandable because "you and I" as a subject sounds pretty natural, and "between you and ..." works as well.
But of course, grammatically speaking, that must be "between you and me".
It seems that Shakespeare once used that phrase, which kind of makes us re-think about what "grammatically correct" means.

"Feti" as the plural of "fetus" or "octopi" as the plural of "octopus" is obviously based on analogy with "stimuli" for "stimulus" (or something like that).
You'll see that this is wrong by looking at the original Latin declension.
English nouns are often based on the Latin nouns in the nominative case.
So, these three words correspond to Latin "fētus", "octōpūs", and "stimulus".
But their plural forms are "fētūs", "octōpodēs", and "stimulī" respectively, which refutes that assumption.

Just to be sure, I checked the Ngram for the words "fetuses" and "feti":
