The English word "congeal" means "to change from a liquid or soft state to a thick or solid state", or simply "to freeze".
This word is composed of the prefix "con-" meaning "together" and the Latin word "gelō" meaning "I freeze".

This Latin word "gelō" is found in many English words, especially those related to certain substances:
- congeal, congelation
- gel, gelation
- gelatin[^gelatin-pron], gelatinous
- gelato, gelati[^italian-plural]
- jelly, jellification

There are some more technical terms, although I don't know what they are: "gelifluction", "gelignite".
The word "gelid" meaning "extremely cold" is not a technical term, but it is rare today.

The Latin "gelō" comes from the PIE "*gel-" (meaning "to be cold, to freeze"[^wik-gel]), which is where the English word "glacier" ultimately comes from.

[^gelatin-pron]: U.S. /ˈdʒɛlətn/
[^italian-plural]: The plurals of "words from Italian that end in the letter 'o'" tend to be formed by replacing the "o" with the letter 'i' (e.g. paparazzo -> paparazzi, virtuoso -> virtuosi, mafioso -> mafiosi). This can be seen in modern Italian grammer as well.
