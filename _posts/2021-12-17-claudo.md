In English, there are many words that end in "-clude".
For example, "include", "exclude", "conclude", "preclude", "seclude", "occlude", and so on.
This "-clude" part comes from the Latin word "claudō", meaning "I shut, close", which more or less makes sense.
Let's take a quick look at some more words of this origin.

## close
Almost needless to say, the word "close" itself comes from the same origin.

## closet, enclosure
These words refer to something that physically makes small closed space.

## clause
Cluases in grammer can be considered a closed unit of words containing a subject and predicate.

## cloister
"Cloister" refers to "a covered walk or arcade connected with a monastery, college, or large church".
You can see what it is by looking at the [images](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=cloister).

## others
The word "claudō" is derived from the PIE "kleh₂w-", meaning "key".
The word "clitoris" meaning "a sexual organ above the vagina" comes from the Ancient Greek "κλείω" meaning "close" (it is "closed" by the labia minora).
"κλείω" ultimately comes from "kleh₂w-" too.
