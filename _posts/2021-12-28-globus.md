English word *conglomerate*[^conglomerate-pron] usually means "a company that owns several smaller businesses" or "a rock that consists of small rounded stones".
It is not difficult to understand these meanings, since the suffix *con-* here means "together".
Then what about the *glomerate* part?

This part *glolerate* is also an English word, meaning "conglomerate", and comes from the Latin *glomerō*, meaning "I make into a ball" (cf. English *agglomerate* (which has the similar meanings)).
Latin *glomerō* comes from *glomus* meaning "ball-shaped mass", which is cognate with *globus*.

*Globus* means "a round object", and has two nice descendants in English.
One obvious descendant is the word *globe*.
The other is *hemoglobin*, which is the combination of *hemo* (meaning "blood", cf. hematophagy) and *globus*.
Looking at the shape of the hemoglobin, this totally makes sense (I don't know if they really have a round shape though).
