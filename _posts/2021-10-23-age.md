## -age
The suffix -age can form nouns that have a collective meaning of what is denoted by the first element. Some common examples are leafage (or foliage), baggage, signage, wordage, etc.

### leafage, foliage
Leafage means leaves collectively. foliage comes from foil, which used to mean "a leaf" (now obsolete), which is not surprising since it means metal rolled into thin sheets.

### baggage
Baggage means bags collectively. Luggage is also a very similar example, but lug itself doesn't have, or never had, any meaning as a noun (although it does make sense since it is a verb meaning "to pull").

### signage
To be honest, I "memorized" this word as "all the signs" a few months ago, but it turns out that I didn't even need to memorize anything. (Needless to say, signage means signs collectively.)

### wordage
Wordage means "words collectively", although this is not a very common term.

### others
I think that "usage" and "language" can be interpreted in the same way. ("laugue" has an obsolete meaning, "manner or style of expression".)
