In English language, we can observe countless etymological relationships between words.
Some connections are clear and easy to understand, but in my opinion, most of them are not trivial and hard to know just by looking at the form or meaning.
How many people can think of the word "umbrella", when they learn the word "somber"?[^umbra]

On the other hand, the opposite can sometimes happen to us (or at least to me).
When I first learned the word "adultery", meaning "sex between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse", I immediately associated it with the word "adult".
That totally makes sense, because it usually happens to adults, and "adult" is the prefix of "adultery".

Also, when I came across the word "adulterate", meaning "to make something impure and poorer in quality, by adding something else", I connect it to "adult" again, and understood it pretty smoothly!
I thought that there must be something related to "changing", and that makes sense too.

But it turns out that both of these assumptions are wrong.
The word "adult" comes from the Latin "adultus" (meaning "grown-up"), which is the perfect participle of "adolēscō" (meaning "I grow up", cf. adolescent).
"Adolēscō" can be further divided into "ad-" (probably meaning "toward") and "olēscō" (meaning "I grow").

"Adultery" and "adulterate", however, come from the Latin "adulterō" (meaning "I commit adultery" or "I adulterate"), which is the combination of "ad-" and "alterō", meaning "I change" (cf. alter).
There's no similarity between the words "olēscō" and "alterō" at all.

Interestingly, the word "adult" has not really changed in form since the 16th centuty:

> 1531   T. Elyot Bk. named Gouernour ii. i. sig. Niv   Soche persons, beinge nowe adulte, that is to saye, passed theyr childehode.[^oed-adult]

But the word "adultery" has so many forms in the past. One of them is "aduoutrye":

> 1525   Ld. Berners tr. J. Froissart Cronycles II. xliii. 139   She was but a bastarde, and borne in aduoutrye.[^oed-adultery]
