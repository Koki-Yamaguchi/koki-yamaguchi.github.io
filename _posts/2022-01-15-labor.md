The Latin verb *lƒÅbor* means "I fall" or "I slip".
This sense remains in English today especially in form *-lapse*.
One obvious example is *lapse*.
Although it has many meanings, they are more or less related to the sense "falling away".

Another example is *collapse*, which is the combination of *con-* (that gets assimilated before *l* and that indicates the completeness) and *lapse*, and means "to fall down suddenly".
There are a couple of more similar words: *elapse* (meaning "(of time) to slip by, pass away"), *relapse* (meaning "an act of falling back into an undesirable state").
