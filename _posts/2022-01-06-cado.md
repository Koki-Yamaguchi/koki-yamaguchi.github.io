The English word *deciduous* means "falling off at a particular time".
When I learned this word, another English word *decide* popped into my mind, but they are not really related to each other.
Instead, it was helpful for me to know that it comes from the Latin *cadō* meaning "I fall".
There's more to it than just *deciduous*, so let me list some more words of the same origin, often with the part *-cas-*, *-cad-*, or *-cid-*.

## accident, coincident, incident, occasion, case, chance
These words all have the senses related to "event" or "figuratively falling (to someone)".

## occidental
This word has a similar form (*-cident-*), but it means "relating to the countries of the West"
This is because the Latin *occidēns* means *west*, to which the sun *falls* down (*occidēns* also means "sunset").

## casual, casualty
These words are not directly related to falling, but one definition of the word *casual* is "done by chance".
*Casualty* often refers to "a person killed due to an accident"

## cascade
A small waterfall

## cadence
The rise and fall of the voice

## chute
Chute or parachute ultimately comes from the same origin.

## decadence
The process of falling away
