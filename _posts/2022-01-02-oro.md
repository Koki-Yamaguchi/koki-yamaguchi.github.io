In English, there are some different expressions that are pronounced similarly.
For example, "ice cream" and "I scream" are pronounced in the same or similar way.
These words are sometimes called *oronyms*.
The *oro* part of *oronym* comes from the Latin *ōrō*, meaning "I orate" or "I pray".

*Oral* and *orate* are clearly derived from this origin.
Let't see some more common words.

## adore
One meaning of this is "to worship" (*ad-* (to) + *ōrō* (I pray)).
Subsequently, the sense "to like very much" became common.

## inexorable
The adjective *inexorable*[^inexorable-pron] means "incapable of being persuaded", or simply "relentless".
This word is the combination of *in-* (denoting negation), Latin *exōrō* (I persuade), and *-able*, where *exōrō* can be further split into *ex-* (out) and *ōrō*, which is totally understandable.
The English word *exorable* also exists and means "capable of being persuaded", but it is rarely used today.

## osculate
In Latin, *ōrō* comes from the noun *ōs*, meaning "mouth".
Latin *ōsculum* means "a kiss" or "a little mouth", which is composed of *ōs* and the diminutive suffix *-culum*.
Thus, English *osculate* generally means "to kiss".

## usher
English word *usher* is often used in the sense "to show someone where they should go".
This word ultimately comes from the Latin *ōs*, via the Latin *ōstium* (meaning "door") and the Old French *ussier* (meaning "doorman").
