In the S1:E4 of the TV series *The Walking Dead*, there's a scene where a man called Merle Dixon cut one of his hands off by himself.
After that, he *cauterized* the stump in order to stop bleeding.
This word *cauterize*[^cauterize-pron] means "to burn body tissue to stop an injury from bleeding".
(I didn't even know the probably corresponding Japanese word, which is 焼灼する.)

*Cauterize* ultimately comes from the Ancient Greek *καίω* (kaíō), meaning "I burn".
There are several words that have the sense related to burning and that have the part *-caut-* or *-caus-*.

## caustic
One definition of this word is "able to burn organic tissue by chemical action".
This is often used in a figurative way to mean "critical" or "bitter".

## holocaust
The Holocaust is the well-known genocide of the European Jews by Nazi Germany during World War II.
This word is the combination of *ὅλος* (hólos) meaning "whole" (cf. *holistic*) and *καίω*.
