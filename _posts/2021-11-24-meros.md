Yesterday, I wrote about [anthimeria](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/11/23/anthimeria.html), which itself is composed of the prefix "ant(h)i-" meaning "opposite" and the Ancient Greek "μέρος" ("méros") meaning "part". In English, μέρος often appears in the form of "-mer-".

## -mer
Some chemical terms have the suffix "-mer", e.g., polymer, isomer.

## -merous
In botany, merosity[^wiki-merosity] refers to the number of component parts in a whorl. With a proper numeric prefix X, we can form the adjective "${X}merous" (e.g., dimerous refers to a whorl of 2 parts).

Although the word "numerous" looks quite similar in form, it comes from a different origin.

## mer-
The word "merit" comes from the Latin "mereō", meaning "I receive a share", which ultimately comes from μέρος.
