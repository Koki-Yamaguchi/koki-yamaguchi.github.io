The English word *pulverize* (meaning "to reduce to powder") comes from the Latin *pulverizō* (meaning "I pulverize"), which is derived from *pulvis* (meaning "powder").
The word *powder* itself comes from the same origin, although these words *pulvis* and *powder* are not really similar in form (the fact that the letter *v* in Classical Latin sounds like /w/ may help us understand this more easily).

One more example from *pulvis* is *pollen*, meaning "a powder produced by the male part of a flower" (Japanese *花粉*, where *粉* means "powder").
