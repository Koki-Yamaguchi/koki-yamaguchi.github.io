As usual. Started reading a book on OAuth 2.0 that the CEO of my company bought for me. (thanks....) I've never read a security book before, so I'm looking forward to it. I want to build a habit of reading software engineering books everyday, which I think I can do in exactly the same way as I have been reading books written in English everyday for more than three months.

When I went out today, I realized that I didn't know the name of the tree with the smelly yellow fruits in English. It is called ginkgo biloba or simply ginkgo. (By the way, I didn't even know the English word for the things that grow on the tree.... (just 'fruits' is fine.)) The term seems to be derived from the Japanese 銀杏 'gin kyo.'
