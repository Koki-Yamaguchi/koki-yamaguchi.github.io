When I came across the English word *hypoxia*, I thought the prefix *hypo-* must indicate something bad or false, judging from the words such as *hypothesis* and *hypocrisy*.
However, it was not quite right.

This prefix *hypo-* comes from the Ancient Greek *ῠ̔πό* (hupó) that basically means "under, near".
Thus, the word *hypothesis* does make sense since a hypothesis is still "under thesis".
The *crisy* part in *hypocrisy* comes from *κρῑ́νω* (krī́nō), meaning "to distinguish"[^krino-cognate].
Although I tried to explain this somehow, I couldn't really figure out how it came to mean "pretense".
*Hypoxia* means "deficiency of oxygen in the tissues".

Some more medical (yet commonly used) terms are easy to understand; the term *hypotension* means "low blood pressure" and *hypothalamus* (視床下部) is a region of the forebrain located below the *thalamus* (視床) (where 下 here means "under").

[^krino-cognate]: cognate with *cernō*, which I wrote about in [this earlier post](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/12/07/cerno.html). They are pretty similar in form and meaning.
