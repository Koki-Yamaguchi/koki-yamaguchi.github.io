Until today, I didn't know the name for the fusible metal used to attach wires to a printed circuit board.
It is called *solder* (U.S. /ˈsɑdər/), which ultimately comes from the Latin adjective *solidus*, meaning "solid", and it makes sense.
Needless to say, the adjective *solid* itself also comes from *solidus*.
There are some more words of the same origin.

## solidus
*Solidus* itself remains in English and refers to "a gold coin of the Roman empire"[^wiki-solidus].
This is because the coin was composed of relatively solid gold.

## consolidate
English word *consolidate* means "to combine several things, especially businesses, so that they become more effective", with the prefix *con-* meaning "together".
The word *solidate* means "to make solid", but it is not commonly used today.
