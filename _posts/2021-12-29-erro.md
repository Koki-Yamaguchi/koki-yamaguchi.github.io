Today, I learned the word *aberrant*[^aberrant-pron] which means "different from what is typical or usual".
This word has the prefix *ab-* (meaning "away") and the substring *err*, so it was not hard to guess what it means (although if you considered the prefix *ab-* as negation of the second element (just like *abnormal*), it would not really make sense).
The *err* part comes from the Latin verb *errō*, meaning "I wander, go astray".

One obvious English descendant of this word *errō* is *err* (or *error*) meaning "to make a mistake".
The second most common word, I assume, is *erratic*, meaning "moving or behaving in a way that is not regular" (to be honest, I didn't notice that this is related to *err*).
Another adjective *errant*[^errant-pron] also has a similar sense, "behaving wrongly".
