## smoking gun
According to Google, a smoking gun means "a piece of incontrovertible incriminating evidence." I can tell what it means, but simply put, a piece of clear evidence that shows someone did commit a crime. If you think of a smoking gun, it's pretty intuitive and easy to remember. This term seems to be used as 'smoking gun evidence' in the context of science as well.

## diaper
The "a" sound in diaper has almost disappeared, making it sound like diper. Any similar case like this?
 
## intra-
This prefix means "within." Today I came across the term "intrauterine" in the context of birth control. This word is a bit confusing at first, unless you are familiar with either "intra-" or "uterine." (For me, unfortunately...) Anyway, I haven't seen (or at least don't remember) any other word with this prefix than intrauterine, so I'll look into it more later.
