The Latin word "mūrus" means "a wall".
In this post, let me write about several words derived from this origin.

## mural
"Mural" means a large picture that has been painted on the wall.
This word itself doesn't really mean "a wall" in a general sense, but it can mean different kinds of walls depending on a particular prefix.
For example, "intramural" means "performed within the walls of a city or building".
In this case, the wall can mean both a physical wall and a metaphorical wall (e.g., "intramural sports" refers to "sports organized within a single educational institution").
"Transmural" means "existing or occurring across the wall of an organ" in the context of medicine.

## pomerium
Pomerium refers to "the religious boundary of a city of Rome"[^wiki-pomerium].
This word is the combination of "post" (behind) and mūrus.

## immure
Lastly, "immure" means "to shut up within walls".
This can be used in a figurative sense.

> To immure himself for three years in a German University.[^oed-immure]
