I like to read English song lyrics, because they often contain interesting slang terms and beautiful poetic expressions.
However, I sometimes find it difficult to tell the difference between expressions written poetically by the artists themselves and those that are commonly used figuratively in conversation.

Here's a quote from the lyrics of the song called *Ferrari* by one of my favorite artists, Bebe Rexha:

> I'm a Ferrari \
> Pulled off on Mulholland Drive \
> Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here \
> I'm a Ferrari \
> And after the party's done \
> I keep on going, missing the moments \
> Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely[^genius-ferrari-by-bebe-rexha]

I read these lyrics quite a while ago, but it was not until today that I realized that the phrase "live in the fast lane" or its variant is actually a common expression (partly because "I'm a Ferrari" is obviously not a common expression).
The term "fast lane" refers to "a lane of a highway for use by traffic that is moving faster than the rest".
It also figuratively means "a lifestyle which is fast-paced, glamorous, hectic, or highly pressured, esp.".

Instead of "life in the fast lane", several compounds are sometimes used, such as "fast-lane lifestyle" or "fast-lane living".
