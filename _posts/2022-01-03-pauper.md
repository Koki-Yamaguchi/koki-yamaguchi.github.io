Latin adjective *pauper* means "poor".
The word *poor* itself comes from this origin.
There are several words that remain in the form *-pau-* or *-pov-* in English, one of which is *poverty*.
Let's take a quick look at some more words.

## impoverish
*Impoverish* is composed of the prefix *im-* (*em-*) (meaning "to put into") and the *-pov-* part, and means "to make poor".
This word is often used in the form "impoverished" as an adjective, just to mean "very poor".
The word *poverish* also exists in English, chiefly in Scottish, meaning "to make poor" (it seems rare though).

## pauper
Exactly the same form *pauper*[^pauper-pron] remains in English, and refers to "a very poor person".

## depauperate
In the context of biology, *depauperate*[^depauperate-pron] means "lacking in numbers or variety of species" (e.g. *depauperate fauna*).
