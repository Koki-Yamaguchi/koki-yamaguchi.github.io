"Daisy" or "common daisy" is the name of a flower.
This word is considered to come from "day's eye".

Here is an idiom with this flower's name.
"To push up daisies" or "to be pushing up daisies" is a common idiom meaning "to be dead (and buried)".
To be dead and buried in the ground would be to be pushing up daisies that are planted on the ground (really?).

This idiom instantly reminds me of the phenomenal song called "Daisies" by Katy Perry.
The lyrics include the following:

> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me  
> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies[^genius-daisies]

Here, "'til they cover me in daisies" can be interpreted as "until I die".

There are some more variations of this idiom: "under the daisies" (meaning "dead and buried") and "to turn one's toes up to the daisies" (meaning "to be dead").
