The Latin word "carō" means "flesh". When I saw this, the first thing that came to my mind was carnival. This word seems to come from the Latin expression "carne levare" meaning "remove flesh"[^wiki-carnival]. It is a festival that takes place before Lent, when some people practice fasting, especially from meat and alcohol.

Carrion, carnage, and carnivore are English words directly related to animal flesh. Carrion means "dead or decaying flesh", while carnage means "a heap of dead bodies". Carnivore is a combination of carō and "devour", and the latter is a common English word meaning "to eat voraciously", which makes perfect sense, saving me the time of explaining what carnivore means.

Other words figuratively related to flesh include incarnate and carnation. Incarnate means "to embody (in flesh)" as a verb and "embodied in flesh" as an adjective. It is interesting that the name of the flower, carnation, also derives from this origin in terms of its color. The next time you see a carnation, you may notice that it somehow resembles the color of animal flesh....
