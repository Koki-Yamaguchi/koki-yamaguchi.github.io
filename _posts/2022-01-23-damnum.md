The Lain noun *damnum* means "damage" or "loss".
The English word *damage* itself ultimately comes from *damnum*, via Old French *dam*, with the suffix *-age* which forms nouns.

There are some more words that have the same origin, with the substring *-damn-* or *-demn-*: *condemn*, *damn*, and *indemnity*.
*Condemn* means "to express strong disapproval, with the intensifying prefix *con-*.
The word *damn* is often used as an exclamation (an expression of anger) or an adjective or adverb (used to emphasize something, e.g., "damn thing", "damn lucky") in an informal speech, but it can also mean "to criticize someone strongly".

I'm not really familiar with the last one, *indemnity*[^indemnity-pron], which means "protection against possible damage or loss".
