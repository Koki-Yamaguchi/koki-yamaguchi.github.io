Today, I watched two YouTube videos about the loss of unstressed vowel in American English.
For example, the word *interesting* is usually pronounced as /ˈɪntrɪstɪŋ/ (three syllables), not /ˈɪntərɪstɪŋ/ (four syllables).
In phonology, this phenomenon is called *syncope*[^syncope-pron][^wiki-syncope].

I knew that some pronunciations are not really fixed.
Looking at [the weblio's entry of the word *chocolate*](https://ejje.weblio.jp/content/chocolate), for example, it says the pronunciation is /tʃάk(ə)lət/.
But how exactly should we pronounce the sound that is expressed as *(ə)*?
I learned some things from the following two videos, so let me share a bit about them.

## First video
[*English Words You’re Probably Mispronouncing ❌Difficult English Pronunciation | Rachel’s English*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opKPVqxE_QY&ab_channel=Rachel%27sEnglish)

She says (1:07):

> Native speakers almost always do the short one.

She shows us a lot of examples of syncope.
Try reading the following words: *family*, *interesting*, *comfortable*, *vegetable*, *chocolate*, *favorite*, *different*, *camera*, *catholic*, *listening*, *memory*, *traveling*, *actually*, *restaurant*, *separate*, *several*, *temperature*, *business*, *every*, *lottery*

According to her, this often happens to the unstressed vowel before the sound /r/, /l/, /m/, /n/, and /ŋ/.

As a result, some words get assimilated and sometimes sound differently, e.g., *restaurant* /ˈrestərɑːnt/ ->  /ˈrestrɑːnt/ -> /ˈrestʃrɑːnt/ (I don't exactly how to express this though).

## Second video
[*Master the American Accent: Vowel Syncope (aka, Words You're Saying Wrong!)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifJfo35xEeA&ab_channel=SanDiegoVoiceandAccent)

She says (1:52):
> Sometimes you must follow the vowel syncope pronunciation. Everyone deletes that syllable, so you need to as well. And other times, it can go either way.

In this video, she delves into several words carefully, rather than list many examples.

According to her opinion (and youglish), the unstressed vewel in *chocolate* and adjective *separate* is always deleted, while in words such as *favorite* and *interested*, it is optional.

## By the way
One more thing.
When the unstressed vowel in the words like *library* or *probably* gets removed, it leads to the two consecutive similar sounds, which sometimes gets assimilated.
So, *probably* is sometimes pronounced like /ˈprɑːbli/, and *library* like /ˈlaɪbri/.
This process is called "haplology"[^haplology-pron][^wiki-haplology].

I like the following from the Wikipedia:

> Linguists sometimes jokingly refer to the phenomenon as "haplogy".
