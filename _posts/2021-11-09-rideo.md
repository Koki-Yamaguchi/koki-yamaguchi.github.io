"Rire" in French means "to laugh". Thinking about the "ri" part, I realized that there are several English words related to laughter that have "ri" as a substring. In fact, they come from the Latin word "rīdeō", meaning "to laugh". In this post, I will show you some words that have this origin.

## ridiculous
One of the most commonly used words is ridiculous, meaning "arousing or deserving mockery or absurd".

## deride
This word is composed of the prefix "de-" and rīdeō. The "de-" here donotes some indignity (cf. detest, delude).

## risible
"Risible"[^risible-pron] means "having the faculty or power of laughing" or "capable of provoking laughter". It is often used almost the same way as ridiculous.

## riant
"Riant" in English means "smiling". The exact same word exists in French as its etymon ("riant" is the present participle of "rire"[^french-present-participle]).

[^risible-pron]: U.S. /ˈrɪzəb(ə)l/ (Some people seem to pronounce it as /ˈrʌɪzəb(ə)l/.)
[^french-present-participle]: In French, the present participle of verbs ending in "-re" (rire) is generally formed by replacing "ons" of the "nous" form (rions) of the present tense with "ant".
