Yesterday, I learned the English word *gawk*, which means "to stare stupidly".
According to the OED, this word is the combination of the obsolete English *gaw* (meaning "to stare") and the suffix *-k*, which has an intensive or iterative effect.

This fact is pretty intriguing to me, because I have never thought carefully about the letter *k* at the end of a word, let alone considered it as a suffix denoting something per se.
Other good examples inclued *talk* from *tale* and *smirk* from *smile*.
