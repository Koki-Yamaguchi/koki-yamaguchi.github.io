When I was reading [the Wikipedia of fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly), I learned that flies are classified as *diptera*, which means "the two-winged flies" or "an order of insects having one pair of membranous wings".
The *ptera* part comes from the Ancient Greek *πτερόν* (pterón) meaning "feather" or "wing".

There are two good examples in English that come from the same origin: *pteranodon* and *helicopter*.
The former is the combination of *pter-* and *anodon*, meaning "without teeth" (instead, they had a crest).
The latter has the prefix *helico-* that means "spiral" (cf. English *helix*).

The word *πτερόν* (pterón) comes from the PIE *\*pétr̥* meaning "feather" or "wing", whence we have the English word *feather*.
