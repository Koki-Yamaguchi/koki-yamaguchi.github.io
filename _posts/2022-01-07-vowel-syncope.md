Today, I watched two YouTube videos about the loss of unstressed vowel in American English.
For example, the word *interesting* is usually pronounced as /ˈɪntrɪstɪŋ/, not /ˈɪntərɪstɪŋ/.
In phonology, that phenomenon is called "syncope"[^syncope-pron][^wiki-syncope].

Looking at the weblio's [entry of the word *chocolate*](https://ejje.weblio.jp/content/chocolate), it says the pronunciation is /tʃάk(ə)lət/, but what exactly does the *(ə)* mean? (Depending on the speaker?)
I learned some things from the videos above, so let me share a bit about them.

## First video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opKPVqxE_QY&ab_channel=Rachel%27sEnglish>

She says (1:07):

> Native speakers almost always do the short one.

She tells us a lot of examples of this pattern.
Try reading the following words: family, interesting, comfortable, vegetable, chocolate, favorite, different, camera, catholic, listening, memory, traveling, actually, restaurant, separate, several, temperature, business, every, lottery

According to her, this usually happens before the sound /r/, /l/, /m/, /n/, and /ŋ/.

## Second video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifJfo35xEeA&ab_channel=SanDiegoVoiceandAccent>

She says (1:52):
> Sometimes you must follow the vowel syncope pronunciation. Everyone deletes that syllable, so you need to as well.
