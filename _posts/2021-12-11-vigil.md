The English noun "vigil" means "a devotional watching" or "an act of staying awake".
In the context of Christian Church, it can refer to "the eve of a festival or holy day".
This word is often used with the verbs such as "keep", "hold", and "stand".
For instance, "The vigil is held from 6-7 p.m."[^camb-vigil].

This word immediately reminds me of another English word "vigilant", which means "always being careful to notice things, especially possible danger".
Both "vigil" and "vigilant" come from the Latin adjective "vigil", meaning "awake" or "watching".
This helps us understand how we can use the word vigilant correctly (whose meaning is not just "careful").

The word "surveillant" is also derived from vigil.
In form, it is not really obvious, while in meaning, it makes perfect sense ("sur-" (above) + "vigil" (watching)).

The Latin vigil comes from the PIE "*we«µ-", meaning "to be awake"[^wiki-weg].
This word has the English descendants such as "vigor" and "wake", which is also totally understandable.
