"Daisy" or "common daisy" is the name of a flower.
This word is considered to come from "day's eye".

Let me share an idiom with this flower name.
"To push up daisies" or "to be pushing up daisies" is a common phrase meaning "to be dead (and buried)".
By being dead and buried in the ground, you probably push up the daisies on the ground (really?).

This idiom instantly reminds me of the phenomenal song "Daisies" by Katy Perry.
The lyrics include the following:

> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me  
> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies[^genius-daisies]

Here, "'til they cover me in daisies" can be interpreted as "until I die".

There are some more vatiations of this idiom: "under the daisies" (meaning "dead and buried") and "to turn one's toes up to the daisies" (meaning "to be dead").
