The English word *curt* was not a new word to me, but it turned out that I misunderstood the meaning a little bit, because I somehow memorized it as an adjective just meaning "rude".
It was not totally wrong, but its definition is actually something like "rude as a result of being very quick" or "rudely brief".
In other words, the sense "short" was an important part of its meaning.

This is perfectly understandable because it comes from the Latin *curtus*, which means "short".
*Curtus* also has an English descendant *curtail*, meaning "to shorten by cutting off a part".

The word *curtus* ultimately comes from the PIE *\*(s)ker-* (to cut off).
The interesting fact (to me) is that the basic English words *short*, *shirt*, and *skirt* all come from this origin.
I can see that these words more or less have the sense "short" or "cut".
