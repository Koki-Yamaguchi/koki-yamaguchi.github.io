## -sicle
A pop ice has a variety of names in different countries. In the US and Canada, it is often called "popsicle." This is the brand name for colored and fruit-flavored ice on a stick.

I didn't know what this suffix -sicle meant until I came across the word "padsicle" today. This refers to frozen sanitary napkins used in underwear to relieve pain after a vaginal birth. I finally realized that -sicle means "frozen." This suffix probably comes from the word "icicle," which makes perfect sense.

Interesting words with this suffix include "snotsicle" and "${someone's-name}-sicle." Snot means "nasal mucus," so snotsicle means "a frozen trail of mucus from the nose." (Will I ever use this word even once in my life?) Some people seem to use it metaphorically, according to [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sicle), combining someone's name with -sicle. This means a person standing in the cold or shivering for some reason.
