In English, we often see words that contain a part "ver".
Even if you don't have any interest in etymology, you may have a certain impression of this part.

In Latin, "vertō" means "I turn".
I picked words that can be easily explained in the sense of "turn" or something similar.

(I tried to separate them into some categories, but please understand them any way you like.)
