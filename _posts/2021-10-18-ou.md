## ou
When I thought about the spelling of "ou" in English, I realized that there are quite a lot of different ways to pronounce it. Even as an English learner, I've never found this pronunciation particularly difficult, but it's an interesting attempt to carefully examine each case and see how we unconsciously distinguish between these sounds (or maybe how we don't know exactly). Here, I will use the UK and US pronunciations registered in the OED.

| words | UK | US |
|-|-|-|
| round | /aʊ/ | /aʊ/ |
| would, tour | /ʊ/ | /ʊ/ |
| though | /əʊ/ | /oʊ/ |
| thought | /ɔː/ | /ɔ/ or /ɑ/ |
| through | /uː/ | /u/ |
| tough | /ʌ/ | /ʌ/ |
| cough | /ɒ/ or /ɔ/ | /ɔ/ or /ɑ/ |
| enough, country | /ʌ/ | /ə/ |
| four | /ɔː/ | /ɔ/ |

So.... maybe I should quit learning English and start learning French...
