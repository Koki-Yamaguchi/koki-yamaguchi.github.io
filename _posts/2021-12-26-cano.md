The Latin word *canō* or *cantō* means "I sing".
This verb is so basic that if you have ever learned Latin before, you probably still remember it.
Especially, *cantō* has the sense of "I enchant", compared to *canō*.
These words have a number of descendants in English, so let's take a look at them.
