The suffix "-phagous" forms lots of interesting English adjectives, meaning "that feeds on X", where X is expressed by the first element of the word.
Honestly, I didn't know most of the words I wrote below, but I found that some of them are really easy to understand with other basic English words.

## anthropophagous
That feeds on human flesh.

The prefix "anthropo-" forms terms relating to humanity or human beings (cf. anthropology).

## helicophagous
That feeds on snails.

The part "helico" means "snail" or "spiral", which makes me understand how the word "helicopter" was formed.

## hemophagous
That feeds on blood.

This word reminds me of the name hemoglobin in the red blood cells.

## oligophagous
That feeds on a restricted range of food.

The prefix "oligo-" means "having few".
"Oligosaccharide"[^oligosaccharide-pron] (in Japanese, オリゴ糖) comes from the same origin.

## ornithophagous
That feeds on birds.

Related English words include "ornithology", meaning "the study of birds".
This term is so commonly used (<https://youglish.com/pronounce/ornithology/english/us>).
