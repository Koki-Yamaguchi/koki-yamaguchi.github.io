In my past [post](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/11/02/frequentative.html) on frequentative, I wrote that the word "gamble" was origninally a frequentative form of "game" ("game" + "le"), but I didn't mention what "-b-" exactly is. These consonants inserted by the influence of euphony is generally called "excrescence"[^excrescence-pron], and there are some other similar examples.

All of these changes are related to nasal consonants (/m/, /n/ (or /ŋ/)).

## ml -> mbl
Examples of this sound change, other than gamble, include the word "tremble". In Middle English, it was actually spelled "tremle".

## n -> nd
"Thunder" was spelled "thoner" or something like this in Middle English.

## g -> ng
There are many examples of an intrusive n before g:
- messanger <- messager
- passanger <- passager
- scavenger <- scaveger
- nightingale <- nightgale
