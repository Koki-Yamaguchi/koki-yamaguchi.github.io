The other day, I realized that there's a relationship between the words *beseech* and *seek*.
To be honest, I have not really thought about *be* as a prefix before.
Thinking about it, however, there are so many English words that start in *be-*.
In this post, let me share a bit about some common words with this prefix.

There seem to be different explanations about the formation depending on the source.
What I wrote about below is basically based on the OED[^oed-be].

## about
First of all, the original meaning of *be-* is "about".
I didn't notice that there's so many prepositions starting in *be*, and they are usually based on the meaning "about" or "near".

For example, there are *before*, *behind*, *below*, *beneath*, *benorth*, *besouth*, *between*, *beyond*, *beside*.

## all about
This prefix *be-* is used as "all about" or "thoroughly", which usually forms intensifying verbs.

e.g. *be-seech* (from *seek*), *bedazzle* (from *dazzle*)

## forms figurative verbs
Also, this prefix can render figurative verbs as well.

e.g. *become* (physically *come*), *behave* (physicaly *have*), *behold* (physically *hold*)

## changes intransitive verbs to transitive
*Be-* functions to render an intransitive verb transitive.

e.g. *bemoan* (*moan* over something), *bewail* (*wail* over something)

## implies a privative force
*Be-* can imply the sense of deprivation as well.

e.g. *bereave*, *benumb*
