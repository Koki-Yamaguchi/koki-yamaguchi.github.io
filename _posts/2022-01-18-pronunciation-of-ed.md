title: Pronunciation of -ed

Long ago, when I first learned the word *naked*, I thought its pronunciation was odd (/ˈneɪkɪd/).
Since then, I have encountered several words that sound similarly: *crooked*, *wicked*, etc.

The other day, I found [an interesting page](http://matters-phonetic.blogspot.com/2014/09/ed-and-d.html) on this topic.
For each word in this list(some ommited), I looked it up on the Internet (mostly the OED and YouGlish) and also talked about it with two native speakers from America. Here's what I found out (or how I understood them).

## always long (/ɪd/)
The words *jagged*, *naked*, *rugged*, *sacred*, and *wicked* are always pronounced as /ɪd/ (long).

## always short (/əd/ (or /ət/))
The words *learned* and *reserved* are almost always pronounced as short, although one native speaker says long *learned* can be acceptable.

## both
The words *beloved*, *blessed*, *cursed*, *legged*, and *winged*[^winged-pron] can be pronounced in both ways (when used not as a verb).
Some say that *beloved* is usually short, while some say it is usually long (in [YouGlish](https://youglish.com/pronounce/beloved/english/us), it is almost always pronounced long).
Long *blessed* seems to be heard in a formal speech today.

The words *crooked* and *wretched* seem to just depend on its part of speech (short for a verb, long for an adjective), although the verb *crook* may not be really common.

As for the word *aged*, some dictionaries specifically state that when it means "very old", it is pronounced long, and otherwise, short.
However, both native speakers I talked to are so accustomed to hearing and pronouncing it as a short one in any sense, and long one just sounds odd or too old.

*Dogged* usually seems to be long, but some say that it is always short, and I'm not really sure.

[^winged-pron]: For the record, long *winged* is pronounced /ˈwɪŋɪd/
