In Latin, "cernō" means "I separate", "I distinguish", or "I decide".
Especially, its derivation "sēcernō" means "I separate" (with the prefix "sē-" implying the meaning of "apart", which can be seen in the word "separate" itself).
In addition, "dēcernō" particularly means "I decide".
Cernō or its derivation explains lots of basic English words.

## discern, secern, secret
These words more or less have the sense of "to separate".
"Discern" baically means "to perceive or distinguish", while "secern" means "to separate", although the latter is rare today.
"Secret" is a bit different, but it can be considered as "separated from public knowledge".

## excrete, secrete
These two words are pretty similar to each other both in their meanings and in form.
With the prefix "ex-" (meaning "outside"), "excrete" makes sense because it specifically refers to the act of discharging waste outside of the body.
On the other hand, "secrete" is not really about "outside", it's just about producing (separating) a certain liquid.

## certain, decree
These words are more related to the meaning of "to decide".
The perfect passive participle of cernō is "certus", which is the exact origin of certain (decided).
For the record, "decree" means "a statement of an official decision".

The word "decide" looks similar, but it seems to have a different origin.
