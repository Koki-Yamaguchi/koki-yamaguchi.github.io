The prefix philo- (or phil- before a vowel or h) forms nouns denoting a liking for the thing specified by the second element. One of the most common words is philosophy. The "sophy" part comes from the ancient Greek word "σοφός"[^greek-sofos], which means wise (cf. sophist). The word "philosophy" was once used as "the love of wisdom" (it is rare today).

A philanthropist is a person who acts benevolently towards others. This is considered to be the combination of phil- and "ἄνθρωπος"[^greek-anthropos] meaning "human being", which is also found in words like anthropology.

Philology is not a very common word, but it is used to mean "historical linguistics". The "log" part comes from "logos," and while I don't know exactly what "logos" technically means, at least I know it's related to "word" and it kind of makes sense.
