English word *distend* means "to swell and become large".
Judging from its form and meaning, there must be something in common.
They both come from the Latin *tendō*, meaning "I stretch" or "I aim".
There are many words from this origin, so I'm going to write a bit about them.

## in the sense "to stretch, extend"
The words *extend*, *distend*, and *tent* have the sense related to stretching physically.
*Tense* means figuratively stretched (nervous and worried).
*Intense* also etymologically meant "stretched", and today it means "very strong or acute".

## in the sense "to direct attention"
There are *attend*, *attention*, *tend* (to care for something), and *intend*, all meaning something like "to aim or direct attention".
By the way, I didn't know that a bartender was (originally) someone who tends a bar.

## in the sense "to expose, show"
The word *ostensible* is composed of *os-* (alternative form of *ob-*, meaning "towards") and *tendō*.
*Pretend* has a similar sense "to show something that is not true".
