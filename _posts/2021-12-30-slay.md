The English word *slay* means "to kill in a violent way".
It also figuratively means "to overwhelm" or "to amaze".
The past tense form is *slew* and the past participle form is *slain*.
However, when used in the sense "to overwhelm", *slayed* seems to be acceptable as the past tense and past participle.

Another English word *slaughter* can be considered as the noun form of *slay* (*slay* + *-(t)er*).
We can see the similar formations in words *laughter* (*laugh*), *fodder* (*feed*), *murder* (Latin *morÄ«* meaning "to die"), etc.
Slaughter today can be used as a verb as well.

Lastly, *onslaught* must have something to do with *slaughter*, which means "a destructive attack".
This word is the combination of the prefix *on-* and *slaught* (obsolete English word meaning "slaughter").
The prefix *on-* here means "leading on to something" (e.g. oncost[^oncost]), so it totally makes sense that *onslaught*(attack) leads on to *slaught*(killing).
