Long ago, when I first learned the word *naked*, I thought that it was pronounced in a strange way (/ˈneɪkɪd/).
After that, I encountered several words that sound similarly: *crooked* and *wicked*.

The other day, I suddenly wondered how many words there are that have the same pattern.
So I looked them up on the Internet and talked about that with a native speaker in America.
Here's what I found out.

- In principle, it is *long* (/ɪd/) if the word is used completely as an adjective, and *short* (/əd/ (or /ət/)) as a participle.
- Information below is based on American English.
- Let the native speaker be *he* below.

## aged
The OED says that if it used in the sense "very old", it is *long* (/ˈeɪdʒɪd/).
Otherwise, it is *short* (/eɪdʒd/).

He says that he always pronounces it *short*.

## beloved
The OED says when it is used as an adjective (meaning "dear"),  long
participle: short

basically short

## blessed
adjective: long
participle: short

## crooked
crooked neck

## cursed

## dogged

## jagged

## learned

## -legged
