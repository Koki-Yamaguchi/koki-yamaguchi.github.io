title: Terms Software Engineers Should Know (1)

Recently, I bought (and started to read) a book *The New Hacker's Dictionary - 3rd Edition* by Eric S. Raymond.
I picked some expressions that I personally found useful or interesting from this book.

## ABEND
*ABEND* or *abend* (/ˈæbɛnd/, /əˈbɛnd/) is the abbreviation for "ABnormal END", i.e., "abnormal termination of software".
This just sounds good to me.

## adger
Hacker's Dictionary defines *adger* (/ˈædʒər/) as "to make a bonehead move with consequences that could have been foreseen with even slight mental effort".
This is really specific and useful.

## AIDS
*AIDS* is short for "A\* Infected Disk Syndrome", where A\* refers to Apple or Amiga, and is of course the result of practicing unsafe *SEX* (Software EXchange).

## amp off
*Amp off* means "to run in background" and comes from the UNIX operator `&` (ampersand)[^bash-amp], which executes a command in the background.
Pretty intuitive and easy to use!

## angry fruit salad
This idiom means "a bad visual-interface design that uses too many colors".

I'll write the following post (2) soon.
