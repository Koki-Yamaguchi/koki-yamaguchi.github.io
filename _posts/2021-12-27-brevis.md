As you probably know, the part *-brev-* or *-bri-* sometimes appears in English words.
E.g., *abbreviate*, *brevity*, *brief*
They come from the Latin *brevis*, meaning "short".
In this post, let's see some more (not really common) words with this part.

# abridge
This word is the doublet of *abbreviate*, and means "to shorten (a text, speech, etc.) whilst retaining the sense".
At first, I thought this word must be related to *bridge*, but it isn't.

# breviloquent
This word is the combination of *brevis* and *loquor* (I speak)[^loq-post].
Thus, it means "using very few words" or "concise"

# breve
In linguistics, *breve* refers to the symbol "˘".
In Latin and Ancient Greek, this sign indicates a short vowel (cf. macron "¯" for a long vowel).

# debrief
This word means "to obtain information from a person on the completion of a mission or after a journey".
The prefix *de-* here means "completely", so I think it can be considered as "to obtian brief but enought information to complete a mission".

# merry
The Latin *brevis* ultimately comes from the PIE "*mréǵʰus", meaning "short".
This origin is not really similar to *brevis* in form, but the sounds *br* and *mr* are similar.
The word *merry* (meaning "happy") also comes from this origin, since happy time flies by pretty quickly.
