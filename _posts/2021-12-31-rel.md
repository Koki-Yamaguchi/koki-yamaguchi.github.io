The English word *doggerel* generally refers to poetry composed in irregular rhythm.
This word partly comes from the word *dog*, which was once used in a depreciative sense, meaning "bad" (e.g. *dog-English*) (now archaic).
It also contains the suffix *-rel*, which forms diminutives, sometimes with derogatory implication.

There are two words suffixed with *-rel* that probably have the sense of both diminutive and negative implication.
One of them is *gangrel*, meaning "a vagrant", and the other is *wastrel*, who is "a good-for-nothing, idle, worthless, disreputable person".

On the other hand, the words "suckerel" and "cockerel" don't have a negative meaning.
Suckerel is equivalent to *suckling*[^diminutive] and means "an unweaned child".
Cockerel is a diminutive form of cock, which usually means "a young male of the domestic chicken".

[^diminutive]: Diminutive is often formed with the suffix *-let* or *-ling*. I wrote about this in [this post](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/10/30/diminutive.html).
