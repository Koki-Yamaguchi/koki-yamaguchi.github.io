Today, I learned the English word *snarf*, meaning "to eat or drink quickly or greedily".
The [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snarf) arguably says that this may be created by combining two English words *snort* and *scarf*.
This reminds me of the word *snark*, which is the combination of *snide* and *remark* (which is the definition of snark).

These words are generally called "blend word".
In the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_word), there are many examples of blend words.
Most of them look strange in form, which means we can somewhat guess that they are probably blend words or something.
But some of them don't really look like a blend word, and it is worth mentioning them here: *smog*, *bit*, and *chortle*.

I did not explicitly know that the word *smog* is the blend of *smoke* and *fog*, which makes perfect sense.
The word *bit* is considered as *binary unit* or *binary digit*.

*Chortle* is a pretty common English word, and one definition of this word is "to laugh in a breathy way".
This meaning is totally understandable because chortle is the blend of *chuckle*(to laugh quietly) and *snort*(make a sudden sound through one's nose).

Both *snark* and *chortle* are coined by an English writer *Lewis Carroll*.
I couldn't find a good source about his word list, but here is [one source](https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-words-coined-by-Lewis-Carroll) (not exhaustive though).
How about that?
