The English word *foment*[^foment-pron] means "to cause something bad to develop".
It ultimatley comes from the Latin *foveō*, which means "I warm" or "I nurture".
Unfortunately, I didn't find any other common words having this origin, but its Latin cognate *febris* (via the PIE *\*dʰegʷʰ-*), meaning "fever", has some descendants.

The following words are derived from *febris*: *fever*, *febrile*[^febrile-pron], and *febrifuge*[^febrifuge-pron] (which are all related to the sense "fever").
*Febrile* means "pertaining to fever".
This word is pretty similar to *feverish* in terms of its definitions, because both also have the figurative sense "showing great excitement", but *febrile* is not often used in this sense compared to *feverish*.

The word *febrifuge* is the combination of *febris* and *-fuge*, the latter of which comes from the Latin *fugō* meaning "I drive away"[^fuge].
Therefore, it means "a medicine adapted to drive away fever".

[^foment-pron]: U.S. /foʊˈmɛnt/
[^febrile-pron]: U.S. /ˈfiːbrɪl/
[^febrifuge-pron]: U.S. /ˈfɛbrəˌfjudʒ/
[^fuge]: Most words ending in *-fuge* (such as *refuge*, *subterfuge*) come from the Latin *fugiō* (I flee), not *fugō* (although they seem to ultimately come from the PIE *\*bʰewg-* (meaning "to flee") anyway).
