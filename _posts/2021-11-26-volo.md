English word "volition" means "the power to use one's will".
Just like the word "will", this word is often used in the form "of one's own volition" ("of" can be replaced by "on" or "by"), which functions as an adverb and means "willingly".

This word comes from the Latin "volō", meaning "I wish or I want"[^latin-volo-meaning].
Volō is considered to be cognate with the English word "will" (The letter "v" in Latin is pronounced like /w/), which is totally understandable.

Other examples of this origin include "voluntary" and "benevolent" (or its opposite, "malevolent"), meaning "characterized by free will" and "desirous of the good of others", respectively.

[^latin-volo-meaning]: Volō in Latin also means "I fly", but I don't go into that in this post.
