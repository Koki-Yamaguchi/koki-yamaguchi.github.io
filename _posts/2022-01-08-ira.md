Recently, I came across the English word *ire*[^ire-pron] in a book.
This word is a poetic and rhetorical expression meaning "anger", often used with the verb *draw* or *raise*.

English *ire* comes from the Latin *īra* that means "anger", which has several descendants in English.
Probably the most common is *irritate* meaning "to make someone angry".

The adjective *irate*[^irate-pron] is a bit harsh word meaning "extremely angry".

In Latin, *-sc-* functioning as an inceptive[^inceptive] infix forms the verb *īrāscor* meaning "to be angry", whence the English *irascible*[^irascible-pron] (meaning "easily provoked to anger") is derived.
