I didn't know that the word "meager" has the meaning "lean or thin".
The Cambridge Dictionary is concise and very useful for practical use, but sometimes it doesn't really tell us important things (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meager)
Anyway, this word comes from the Latin adjective "macer", meaning "lean".

"Meager" and "macer" might look quite different at first.
The letter "c" in "macer" is pronounced as /k/ that is close to the sound /g/, which helps us understand a bit more.

Another common example of this origin is "emaciated", which contains the prefix "ex-"[^ex-formation] (meaning "thoroughly") and macer.
Thus, emaciated means "excessively thin".
The verb form "emaciate" does exist in English, meaning "to make lean", but it's not commonly used at all.

One more word, "macilent"[^macilent-pron].
This word means "thin", which is rare today though.

[^ex-formation]: The prefix "ex-" gets reduced before "m". I wrote about this in [this post](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/11/12/ex.html).
[^macilent-pron]: U.S. /ˈmæsələnt/
