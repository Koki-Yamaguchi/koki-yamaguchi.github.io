title: Blend Word

Today, I learned the English word *snarf*, meaning "to eat or drink quickly or greedily".
The [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snarf) arguably says that this may be formed by combining two English words *snort* and *scarf*.
Aside from whether this is correct or not, it reminds me of another word *snark*, which is the combination of *snide* and *remark* (which is the definition of snark).

These words are generally called "blend word".
In the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_word), there are many examples of blend words.
Most of them look odd in form so that we can kind of guess that they are probably blend words or something.
However, some of them do not really look like a blend word, so it is worth mentioning some of them here: *smog*, *bit*, and *chortle*.

I did not explicitly know that the word *smog* is the blend of *smoke* and *fog*, which makes perfect sense.
The word *bit* is considered as *binary unit* or *binary digit*.

*Chortle* is a pretty common English word, and one definition of this word is "to laugh in a breathy way".
This meaning is totally understandable because chortle is the blend of *chuckle*(to laugh quietly) and *snort*(make a sudden sound through one's nose).

Both *snark* and *chortle* are coined by an English writer *Lewis Carroll*.
I couldn't find a good source for a list of words he invented, but here is [one source](https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-words-coined-by-Lewis-Carroll) (not exhaustive though).
How about that?
