It is famous that the English word *bird* comes from the Middle English *brid* (or the Old English *bridd*).
I found it a little bit strange at first, because they just sounded really different.

However, it turns out that this process of two letters being swapped is pretty common in any languages and is called *metathesis*[^0] (Japanese *音位転換).
Even though [the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metathesis_(linguistics)#English) shows some examples, these words are not quite interesting, etymologically speaking.
So, let me go through some more words that I personally found interesting.

#### crud, curd

scurf, scruff
fimbria, fringe

### Japanese
山茶花
雰囲気
新しい
秋葉原
