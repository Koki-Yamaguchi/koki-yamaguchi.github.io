## Redivivus
Redivivus means "brought back to life". Its etymon is the Latin word redivīvus. Since the Latin prefix red- can function in the same way as the prefix re-[^latin-red] , we can assume that the word is the combination of red- and "vivus". As you probably know, the latter word comes from the word "vīvō", which means "I live or I survive".

While the word revive is a much more general term meaning to bring back to life and can be used in a wide range of contexts, redivivus is used today usually as postmodifier. (e.g. Nero Redivivus)
