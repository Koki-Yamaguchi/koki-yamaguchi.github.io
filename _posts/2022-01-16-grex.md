I remember that, several years ago, I tried to memorize the meaning of an English word *gregarious* ("sociable"), but somehow I couldn't remember it, even though I tried to repeatedly.
Then, I looked it up on the Internet, and understood this word by associating it with another English word *segregate*, which I had already known.
The *-greg-* part in English often means "flock", which comes from the Latin *grex* meaning "flock".
The word *segregate* can be interpreted as "separate a flock", because the prefix *se-* indicates the sense "apart" (cf. *separate*), and it was totally understandable.

There are some more with this substring *greg*: *aggregate*, *congregate*, and *egregious*.
The first one *aggregate* is used as a noun, adjective, and verb, and they have the senses related to "combining into a single group".
The second one *congregate* means "to gather into a crowd".
*Egregious* is a bit different and means "conspicuously bad" (from the original meaning "standing out from the flock")[^past-post].

[^past-post]: I refered to *egregious* in [my past post about the prefix *ex-*](https://koki-yamaguchi.github.io/2021/11/12/ex.html#egregious)
