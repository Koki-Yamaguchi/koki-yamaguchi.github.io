When I learned the word *concoct*, I looked up its etymology and found that it comes from the Latin word *coquō*, which means "I cook" or  "I ripen" (or *coctus*, past participle of *coquō*, meaning "cooked").
It is totally understandable since *concoct* today means "to make up by mixing a variety of ingredients", with the prefix *con-* meaning "together".
This word has many English descendants related to cooking, including *cook*, *cuisine*, *kitchen*, and so on.
In this post, let's see some more words.

## biscuit
Biscuit is composed of the prefix *bis-* (variant of *bi-*) meaning twice and *coctus*.
Thus, it literally means "twice baked", and according to Wikipedia, this is because:

> biscuits were originally cooked in a twofold process: first baked, and then dried out in a slow oven.[^wiki-biscuit]

## terracotta
The Latin word *terra* means "the dry land" or "soil" (cf. *terrain*).
So *terracotta* means "cooked earth".
(If you don't know what it is, take a look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta).)

## precocious
As you may know, the word *precocious* means "prematurely developed".
This word is the combination of the prefix *pre-* (in advance) and *coquō* as the sense "I ripen".
This corresponds to the Japanese translation *早熟の* (*早* means can be regarded as "pre-" and *熟* "ripe").
